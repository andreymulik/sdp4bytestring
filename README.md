# SDP for ByteString

SDP to ByteString is an implementation of the core SDP classes for ByteString.

## Reasons

ByteString is one of the best libraries on the Haskell Platform - it combines
simplicity, versatility, and efficiency. ByteString used in an impressive number
of various projects. For these and some other reasons, I chose ByteString as the
first library that SDP will support through extensions.

## Versioning

sdp4bytestring follows of the[Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and SDP
wrapper rules.
