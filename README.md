# SDP for ByteString

SDP for ByteString is an implementation of the core SDP classes for ByteString.

## Reasons

ByteString is one of the best libraries on the Haskell Platform - it combines
simplicity, universality and efficiency. ByteString used in an impressive amount
of projects. For these and some other reasons, I chose ByteString as the first
library that SDP will support (through extensions).

## Versioning

sdp4bytestring follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and SDP
wrapper rules.
